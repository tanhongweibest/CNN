(1) Implementing Orthogonal kernel initialization for 2DConv by Pytorch


(2) The oringinal of the code is "Dynamical Isometry and a Mean Field Theory of CNNs:How to Train 10000-Layer vanilla Convolutional Neural Networks", https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05393


(3) Inference code:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v1.9.0-rc0/tensorflow/python/ops/init_ops.py


(4) Add the orthogonal init kernel of the ConvT2D
